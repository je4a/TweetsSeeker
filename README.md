In order to make this code work you'll have to create twitter4j.properties file and put it next to local.properties file.
It has to contain consumerKey, consumerSecret, accessToken, accessTokenSecret. You can obtain them from https://apps.twitter.com/

consumerKey="YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"<br>
consumerSecret="YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"<br>
accessToken="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"<br>
accessTokenSecret="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"

Having accessToken/Secret doesn't require us to login with Twitter account.
